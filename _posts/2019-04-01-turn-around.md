### Turnaround
	Turn around I'm right behind you
	Turn around I'll turn around too
	Turn around so we can hold hands
	Turn around it's ligter flatter
	Turn around hot peas and buffer
	Turn around I'm flowing in the grass
	Straight how can you be so straight
	Life's everything but straight
	It's going up and down
	Far happiness isn't far
	Not far from where you are
	Watching your life go by
	Now why don't you sing out loud
	To the tune you keep inside
	
	Turn around around the circle
	Turn around just like duetto
	Turn around and listen to the wind
	Turn around and put your pen down
	Turn around your feet off the ground
	Turn around and your head in the clouds
	Shy how can you be so shy
	Hiding below the stars
	Under your neon light
	Hi don't say hello say hi
	Hi to a higher sky
	Hi to a higher ground
	Loud why don't you sing out loud
	The words you keep inside
	Why don't sing it out loud
	Why don't you sing out loud
	The song you keep inside
